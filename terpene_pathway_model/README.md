##Before Running:

- Ensure scipy, matplotlib, numpy are all installed
- Ensure models run individually with defaults by running `full_dynamics.py` and `tp.py`

##To Run:

- Calling `python3 full_run.py` runs the model with 0 concentration of Acetyl-CoA
- Modify the call to `run_sans_acetyl_coa` to run with different initial conditions
- If successful, `infinite.png` contains concentrations at the end of the MVA pathway model, and `Terpene Precursors.png` the final concentrations
